In April 2022 Martin Kaptein finished his Master's Thesis and Research at the *Fontys* Conservatory of Tilburg, The Netherlands.
The topic of the presentation was *Colors in Alexander Scriabin’s Sonata No.8 Op.66: Exploring the relation between color and harmony in Scriabin’s music*.
This can be described as the first step to revolutionize the perception of music, with wide-ranging effects for piano performance practice, music education and audience perception.
