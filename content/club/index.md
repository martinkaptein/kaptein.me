# Scriabin Club

> Scriabin Club thrives to make the world a better place through art.

## What is Scriabin Club?

Scriabin Club was founded in November 2020 by Martin Kaptein with the goal to unite the people who like the visionary composer *Alexander Scriabin*, his ideas and music.
This is the place for **conversations about Art and Life**.
